This is an admin dashboard app for CVNZ, a health and security company working in nature. This app helps them organize their activities for different projects they manage.

Admins can assign staff and volunteers to projects and monitor all objectives they set for each project. They can also track risks and hazards and see all details about any incidents. If needed, they can send incident details by email to whoever they want.

For each project, there are several activities to make sure all objectives are completed. Admins can check the reports page to see how much of a project's goals have been achieved and plan the next steps to reach their targets.

This app makes it easier for CVNZ to stay organized, keep track of work progress, and manage risks efficiently.
